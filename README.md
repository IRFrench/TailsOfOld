# Tails of Old

Tails of old is my story telling website. It was made using Go, HTMX and Tailwind as a test of the technology.

## The user story

The user story of my webpage

### First impression

The landing page. A three tier section showing the different selections of the website. These being programming, games and stories.

Each section should be designed to be eye catching and overview what is in this section

### Sections

Each section should be unique and independent from everything else.
